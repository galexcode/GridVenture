make it so that all cells are evaluated, then the changes are applied.
if you evaluate fire, then apply fire's effects, that will skew the simulation.
we need to have all materials being evaluated, then their effects need to be applied to the grid.
that way, everything will have an equal chance of affecting something.

modify the print_cells to only print cells that have changed. get this data from the cellChanged[][] array in the evaluate_cells() function.
