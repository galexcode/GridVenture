#GridVenture
*A sandbox adventure rpg*

###About
This is a game like Terraria, but it will be much more story oriented. I want to make a complex event/quest system that will allow the user to take many different paths through the game.

###Playing the Game
To play the game, simply download the release from mediafire here:

[GridVenture 0.3 - .7z](http://www.mediafire.com/download/744baw4posktrwu/GridSim_v0.3.7z)

[GridVenture 0.3 - .zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a6thag5j9bzg34i/GridSim_v0.3.zip)

*Note: Release Version 0.3 was the latest release of the game before it was taken in a different direction. The game is currently goin in an adventure/rpg direction. When v0.3 was released, the game was a simulation type game. However, it was still pretty fun. So do try it out regardless.*

Alternatively, navigate to the

**bin/Release History/**

directory. There you will find every release version of the game - including the latest one.
*(Note: if a release folder does not contain a .zip and a .7z file, that means that release is currently being built)*



There are some "interesting" gems in the

**bin/debug**

directory. There are several version of the game in there that were not official releases, but I thought were noteworthy in some way and wanted to save the exe of that build.
