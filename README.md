##GridVenture
*A sandbox adventure rpg*

###About
This is a game like Terraria, but it will be much more story oriented. I want to make a complex event/quest system that will allow the user to take many different paths through the game.

###Playing the Game
If you want to play the latest release, go into the

**bin/Release History/**

directory. There you will find every release version of the game - including the latest one.
*(Note: if a release folder does not contain a .zip and a .7z file, that means that release is currently being built)*



There are some "interesting" gems in the

**bin/debug**

directory. There are several version of the game in there that were not official releases, but I thought were noteworthy in some way and wanted to save the exe of that build.
