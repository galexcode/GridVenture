/// THIS FUNCTION WILL APPLY A TRANSFORMATION TO TURN A SOLID STRING OF TEXT INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER STRINGS OF TEXT CALLED "LINES" 
// msg is the string of text that will be broken up into lines of text.
// lineWidth is the number of characters on each line.
// lineHeight is the number of lines tall the paragraph will be limited to.
// lines is the pointer to an array of strings (a pointer to an array of pointers).
	// lines points back to an array of strings that each contain part of the paragraph.
	// the first string (lines[0]) will be the first line of the paragraph.
	// the seconds string {lines[1]) will be the second line of the paragraph.
// finalWidth  is the biggest width that any one of the lines ended up being after the transformation.
// finalHeight is how many lines the paragraph transformed into.
	// both finalWidth and finalHeight are pointers to memory where the function will store the values of the final width and height of the transformed paragraph.
	// when the function is called, you will need to provide a pointer to a memory location where these values can be stored.
void paragraph_to_lines(char *msg, Uint16 linewidth, Uint16 lineHeight, char **lines, Uint16 *finalWidth, Uint16 *finalHeight){
	
	// it is a work in progress.
