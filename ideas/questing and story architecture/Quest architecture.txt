most quests will have subquests.

the format of the quest system might look like this:

struct Quest{

	// prerequisites are quests that need to be completed before you have access to the current quest.
	Prerequisites{
		Quest1
		Quest3
		Quest16
		Ques9
		...
	}
	
	// corequisites are quests that you need to have started. Coreq's might be unnecessary...
	Corequisites{
		Quest14
		Quest3
		...
	}
	
	// each subquest is a smaller part of the main quest. they contain bits and pieces of the original goals.
	// imagine your main quest is to grow some food...
	SubQuests{
		1	plant crops
		2	water crops
		3	harvest crops
		...
	}
	
	// goals are things that need to be satisfied in order to complete the quest.
	// goals basically describe the quest.
	Goals{
		- reached certain level
		- attained certain items
		- visited certain places
		- talked to certain people
	}
	
	// these are meta information about the quest.
	// these are mostly true/false flags.
	Metadata{
		- quest finished
		- quest available
		- quest started
	}
	
}
