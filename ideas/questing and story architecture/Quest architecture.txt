most quests will have subquests.

the format of the quest system might look like this:

struct Quest{

	// prerequisites are quests that need to be completed before you have access to the current quest.
	Prerequisites{
		Quest1
		Quest3
		Quest16
		Ques9
		...
	}
	
	// corequisites are quests that you need to have started. Coreq's might be unnecessary...
	Corequisites{
		Quest14
		Quest3
		...
	}
	
	// each subquest is a smaller part of the main quest. they contain bits and pieces of the original goals.
	// imagine your main quest is to grow some food...
	SubQuests{
		Quest_x_1: plant crops
		Quest_x_2: water crops
		Quest_x_3: harvest crops
		...
		Quest_x_n: ...
	}
	
	// goals are things that need to be satisfied in order to complete the quest.
	// goals basically describe the quest.
	Goals{
		- reached certain level
		- attained certain items
		- visited certain places
		- talked to certain people
	}
	
	// these are meta information about the quest.
	// these are mostly true/false flags.
	Metadata{
		- quest finished
		- quest available
		- quest started
	}
	
}

it will evaluate the quests and see if the user has started a quest, finished it, or even if it is available.
to make sure it is watertight, it would loop through checking each quest until there are no new updates.
i.e. if you unlock the ability to do another quest, then you
