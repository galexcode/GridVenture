make an adventure where you have to consult with a storm god.
maybe you change the rain dynamics by talking to him?
make him angry and it rains?
I dunno.
He would be more like a demigod than a god.
he would have phisical form and be mostly in contorl of the rain.

Maybe there are multiple demigods in the game. and you have to go on a quest for each one of them to unlock the weather that each one provides.

maybe there are doors that lead into other places in the game.
like if there are castles, maybe there is a door on the castle that leads into the castle's interior.
and the interior of the castle is an entirely different world that would resemble the interior of the castle.

I dunno. I don't like this idea.

I'd rather have portals that go to entirely different worlds.
like portals that lead to different procedurally generated worlds.
so there are an infinite amount of worlds that you can go to.
or maybe every time you make a portal, it generated a new world for you.

I'm going to make different colored materials.
make materials have two colors instead of just one!
make blocks that have colored centers, colered sides, or maybe even stripes!
and make a block with a gradient.
There are going to be a lot of complex textures if I implement this.
It would be smart to generate all of the textures (at boot) on a surface (a sprite sheet) and then simply blit the pre-rendered images (with clips) to the screen when updating the screen.
so that instead of rendering the material each time, you can simply copy and paste what you have already rendered at program startup.
