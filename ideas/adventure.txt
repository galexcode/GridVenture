make an adventure where you have to consult with a storm god.
maybe you change the rain dynamics by talking to him?
make him angry and it rains?
I dunno.
He would be more like a demigod than a god.
he would have phisical form and be mostly in contorl of the rain.

Maybe there are multiple demigods in the game. and you have to go on a quest for each one of them to unlock the weather that each one provides.
