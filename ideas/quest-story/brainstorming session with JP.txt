I want to put a bowl and pestle in GridVenture
and before you ask what it is, here are some images

 36:41  Ryan Jensen: you can harvest wheat (among other things) and manually grind them up with the bowl and pestle as a tool
 36:50  JPisaBrony: i know what that is, it was in runescape. (you made potions with it)
 36:55  Ryan Jensen: xD
 36:55  Ryan Jensen: ok
 37:03  Ryan Jensen: I thought you might also know what it is because of breaking bad
 37:18  JPisaBrony: ah yeah, i remeber them using it
 37:19  Ryan Jensen: I think they use it breifly in a single episode
 37:20  Ryan Jensen: xD
 37:27  Ryan Jensen: in some meth baking montage
 37:30  JPisaBrony: yeah. lol
 37:46  JPisaBrony: so anyways... what were you going to say
 38:03  Ryan Jensen: I just want to have that in GridVenture
 38:09  Ryan Jensen: I think it would be cool
 38:11  Ryan Jensen: grind up wheat
 38:13  Ryan Jensen: make flour
 38:15  Ryan Jensen: make bread
 38:19  JPisaBrony: >runescape
 38:21  JPisaBrony: lol
 38:23  Ryan Jensen: xD
 38:27  JPisaBrony: thats exactly what you do to make bread
 38:31  Ryan Jensen: yeah I know
 38:36  Ryan Jensen: in the REAL WORLD TOO!
 38:40  Ryan Jensen: xD
 38:43  JPisaBrony: xD
 38:55  Ryan Jensen: I'm thinking of adding silverware to the game
 39:03  JPisaBrony: wat. lol
 39:17  Ryan Jensen: maybe they would add a bonus to whatever you eat
 39:28  Ryan Jensen: using a fork... makes the food... last longer?
 39:29  Ryan Jensen: I don't know
 39:31  JPisaBrony: is there going to be a deleted scene were you eat something with it?
 39:36  Ryan Jensen: WAT
 39:37  Ryan Jensen: xD
 39:40  JPisaBrony: like in 3D
 39:43  JPisaBrony: xD
 39:43  Ryan Jensen: LOL
 39:48  Ryan Jensen: that would be weird as shit
 39:52  JPisaBrony: i know. lol
 39:57  Ryan Jensen: to have some random 3D scene in a 2D game xD
 40:21  JPisaBrony: thats what i though of when you mentioned silverware. lol
 40:25  Ryan Jensen: xD
 40:55 PM | Edited 41:21  JPisaBrony: well, a 2D scene eating something you wouldnt see much, so why not make it 3D?
 40:59  JPisaBrony: xD
 41:40  Ryan Jensen: lol
 41:52  Ryan Jensen: maybe you can equip silverware
 42:04  JPisaBrony: and stab people with your fork
 42:05  Ryan Jensen: and they make it so that everything you eat gives you a little more health
 42:09  Ryan Jensen: lol
 42:19 PM | Edited 42:37  JPisaBrony: [Sunday, November 17, 2013 42  Ryan Jensen: 

<<< everything you eat>eat dirt
 42:32  Ryan Jensen: i was thinking the silverware part would be a seperate part of your equipment screen
 42:44  JPisaBrony: ok
 43:14 PM | Edited 43:24  Ryan Jensen: like, you have two spots (for weapons/sheilds) eight spots for body armor, and some spots for dining equipment
 43:38 PM | Edited 43:44  JPisaBrony: 8 spots for amor? what are you going to wear? lol
 43:48 PM | Edited 45:44  JPisaBrony: pants
tie
shoes
shirt
hat
socks
facemask
gloves?
 44:23  Ryan Jensen: LOL
 44:50 PM | Removed 45:14  JPisaBrony: This message has been removed.
 45:48  Ryan Jensen: body armor spots:
right boot
left boot
right legging
left legging
chestplate
right arm
left arm
right hand
left hand
head
amulet/necklace area
earings
hand rings (right and left)
 45:50  Dalek SEC: http://youtu.be/ca-qF8CYFH0?t=4m26s
 46:07  Ryan Jensen: so it is more like 13 or 22
 46:10  JPisaBrony: ok
 46:15  Dalek SEC: How I love youtube
 46:17  Ryan Jensen: depending on how many fingers you allow the player to wear rings on
 46:21  JPisaBrony: >left AND right boot
lol
 46:23  Ryan Jensen: xD
 46:34  JPisaBrony: oh shit, i only have 1 boot!
 46:34  Ryan Jensen: I don't know
 46:45  Ryan Jensen: I just thought it could add a level of intrigue to the game
 46:48  JPisaBrony: ok
 46:50  Ryan Jensen: more detailed armor setup
 46:55 PM | Edited 46:57  Ryan Jensen: i'm going to save this conversation
 47:24  JPisaBrony: yeah, it is a good idea, i would have to see the setup to make more sense of it
 48:18  Ryan Jensen: I'm thinking there would be an armor slot for what is up your ass as well
 48:24  JPisaBrony: xD
 48:24  JPisaBrony: lol
 48:26 PM | Edited 48:29  Ryan Jensen: or what kind of underwear you are wearing
 48:36  JPisaBrony: >dildo up my ass
 48:44  Ryan Jensen: > +5 attack speed
 48:47  JPisaBrony: xD
 48:47  Ryan Jensen: xD
 49:13  JPisaBrony: but the stupid jokes aside, i like it
 49:28  Ryan Jensen: me too
 49:43  Ryan Jensen: I think the armour screen is going to be rather detailed
 49:44  JPisaBrony: :o we can like it TOGETHER FOREVER
 49:49  Ryan Jensen: YES
 50:06  JPisaBrony: maby a whole new screen, kind of like de_flux?
 50:10  Ryan Jensen: yeah
 50:11  Ryan Jensen: I like that
 50:23  Ryan Jensen: with a stickman type drawing behind the armor slots
 50:27  JPisaBrony: we should make it so you can drag and drop your items into the slots
 50:31  Ryan Jensen: (i'm thinking drag-and-drop)
 50:32  Ryan Jensen: yeah
 50:36  Ryan Jensen: nice timing
 50:38  JPisaBrony: xD
 50:57  Ryan Jensen: so the user's inventory should be displayed along side the equipped armor
 51:11  JPisaBrony: and then it shows you what you gain from each armour so we can make a ton of useless armour and make the player try and figure out which one is best
 51:23 PM | Edited 51:25  JPisaBrony: yeah, defenetly
 51:39  Ryan Jensen: YES
 51:49  Ryan Jensen: just to make people confused about the armor
 51:58  Ryan Jensen: and make a ton of really weird combination rules
 52:02  JPisaBrony: lol
 52:10  Ryan Jensen: like if you wear a cape and a thong, you get +10 speed
 52:15  JPisaBrony: that could actually make it quite complex
 52:18  Ryan Jensen: yeah that would
 52:29 PM | Edited 52:37  JPisaBrony: >cape and thong xD
 52:38  Ryan Jensen: I'm liking the idea of having a thong in the game
 52:47  JPisaBrony: yeah, why not? xD
 52:48  Ryan Jensen: xD
 53:06  Ryan Jensen: actually, that combination of armor thing sounds really cool  :3
 53:36  Ryan Jensen: maybe the player would have to spend "research points" to discover what weapons/armor work well together
 53:54  JPisaBrony: hmm, interesting. but were would those points come from?
 53:58  Ryan Jensen: I don't know
 54:09  JPisaBrony: questing? xD
 54:14  Ryan Jensen: maybe you get these points from questing or fighting
 54:17  JPisaBrony: >runescape once again
 54:23  Ryan Jensen: >runefag once again
 54:25  Ryan Jensen: xD
 54:27  JPisaBrony: yep
 54:27 PM | Edited 54:29  JPisaBrony: xD
 55:02  JPisaBrony: fighting would probly be the best option, since monsters will be infinite were as quests arent
 55:11  Ryan Jensen: right
 55:13  Ryan Jensen: good point
 55:23  JPisaBrony: inless we want to make an ass load of quests. lol
 55:29  Ryan Jensen: or, maybe, in the game there is just GIANT DICK that you have to suck to get research points
 55:45  JPisaBrony: xD
 55:56 PM | Edited 56:03  JPisaBrony: but HOW
 55:57 PM | Removed 56:02  JPisaBrony: This message has been removed.
 56:15  Ryan Jensen: or maybe there is a finite number of things to research
 56:24  JPisaBrony: if there are, then quests would work
 56:25  Ryan Jensen: so finishing all the quests will allow you to see all the good combos
 56:31  Ryan Jensen: yeah
 56:57  JPisaBrony: but if it becomes more dynamic then that, then we would need to switch it to something infinite
 57:06  Ryan Jensen: yeah
 57:16  Ryan Jensen: however, this whole system is kind of pointless if someone just wants to look up "good GridVenture armor combos"
 57:22  Ryan Jensen: and finds the wiki page
 57:40 PM | Edited 57:50  JPisaBrony: well, someone would have had to do them atleast once.
 57:44  Ryan Jensen: sure
 57:58  Ryan Jensen: which makes me think we should randomly generate good and bad cobos for every weapon/armor pair at the beginning of the game
 58:11 PM | Edited 58:12  Ryan Jensen: so for every game you play, the rules of the weapons are different
 58:32  JPisaBrony: yeah, i like that so that each player gets a new adventure
 58:43  Ryan Jensen: (and this could be thought of as your player having different affinities for certain weapons and having some disaffinities for other weapons)
 58:45  Ryan Jensen: yes
 58:55  Ryan Jensen: so maybe one of your characters is really good with axes
 59:02 PM | Edited 59:03  Ryan Jensen: another is better with a giant dildo bat
 59:13  JPisaBrony: lol
 59:28  Ryan Jensen: and yet others are better at just sucking the giant dick for research points
 59:45  JPisaBrony: what about:(*idea*) skill points so that you can choose what your character would be good at
 59:56  JPisaBrony: lol
00:08 Ryan Jensen: ooh
00:16 Ryan Jensen: so you would be able to develop your character's skills?
00:19 JPisaBrony: yes
00:23 Ryan Jensen: interesting
00:24 Ryan Jensen: i like it
00:26 JPisaBrony: then it WOULD be an RPG
00:26 JPisaBrony: lol
00:41 Ryan Jensen: so maybe we wouldn't do combos then
01:06 Ryan Jensen: I think we should either do your idea or the one we were talking about before
01:08 Ryan Jensen: not both
01:13 Ryan Jensen: that could get hectic
01:28 Ryan Jensen: well, maybe not...
01:30 Ryan Jensen: I don't know
01:45 JPisaBrony: just throwing out ideas, since we seem to be in a brainstorming mood atm. lol
01:50 Ryan Jensen: yep
02:00 Ryan Jensen: I like that idea
02:10 Ryan Jensen: you can choose what kind of weapons you like.
02:40 Ryan Jensen: one of my friends today brought up the question of making decisions in the game
03:05 JPisaBrony: >game broken
03:05 Ryan Jensen: like, being able to say multiple things and get different quests opened up
03:14 JPisaBrony: ok
03:55 Ryan Jensen: as in, if you ask the guy about his wife, you open the "having an affair" quest.
but if you ask him about his business, you open the "undercover arson" quest.
04:11 JPisaBrony: but, then you cant CATCH EM ALL
04:13 Ryan Jensen: xD
04:34 Ryan Jensen: I was thinking that after you are done with a superquest, you can redo all of the quests inside it
04:44 JPisaBrony: well, that would make for a very interesting gameplay, as you would have to choose between rewards
04:49 Ryan Jensen: (a superquest is a collection of similarly themed quests)
04:52 JPisaBrony: ah, ok
05:19 Ryan Jensen: (e.g. the "Demigods" superquest would be all of the quests where you help the demigods turn the weather back on)
05:42 Ryan Jensen: yeah
06:40 JPisaBrony: ok, that might be the best idea, so that we dont have to make rewards specific to certain quests, and you can just get all the rewards eventually
06:47 Ryan Jensen: yeah
06:52 Ryan Jensen: however, the more I think about it
07:00 Ryan Jensen: doing that would make the quest system very very complicated
07:00 JPisaBrony: yeah... i can go either way
07:22 Ryan Jensen: so maybe we'll stick to "once it is done, it is done. period" for now.
07:48 Ryan Jensen: You know how most quests will have requirements?
08:10 JPisaBrony: they will? lol
08:17 AM | Edited 12:08:24 Ryan Jensen: e.g. before you can start the "Dragon Slayer" quest, you have to complete the "Forge a Master Sword" quest
08:33 JPisaBrony: anything else...? lol
08:48 AM | Edited 12:08:50 JPisaBrony: well, that is getting ahead of myself a bit
08:57 Ryan Jensen: i've been thinking that quests should have negative requirements
09:11 JPisaBrony: negative requirements!? lol. i like that
09:35 Ryan Jensen: like, if you complete the "kill James" quest, then you cannot possibly attempt the "Go hunting with James" quest
09:49 JPisaBrony: ok
10:08 Ryan Jensen: maybe there would be a guy who says, "Hey! James said he wanted to go hunting with you!"
10:30 JPisaBrony: i was thinking something else, like maby you needed to equip/ not have certain equipment equipt to start the quest
10:30 Ryan Jensen: and after you kill him that npc would say, "James wanted to go hunting with you... but I guess that won't be possible anymore"
10:31 Ryan Jensen: xD
10:37 Ryan Jensen: interesting
10:39 JPisaBrony: xD
10:58 AM | Edited 12:42 Ryan Jensen: I had thought about quests requiring you to have items to COMPLETE the quest
02 Ryan Jensen: but not to START it
04 JPisaBrony: but... thinking about it, players could just equip the items after they start the quest. lol
04 Ryan Jensen: that is interesting
08 Ryan Jensen: right
24 JPisaBrony: to hate items? lol
34 Ryan Jensen: yes
35 Ryan Jensen: xD
38 Ryan Jensen: *have
43 JPisaBrony: ah, ok.
45 Ryan Jensen: :P
50 Ryan Jensen: I was thinking a simple first quest might be, "gather some logs"
12:12 JPisaBrony: second quest:
fuck the logs
12:19 Ryan Jensen: LOL
12:20 Ryan Jensen: and then when that is complete, a new quest is available to start:
"make a picaxe"
12:25 JPisaBrony: ok
12:40 Ryan Jensen: I think the first few quests would guide the player along and teach him/her how to play the game
12:43 JPisaBrony: so kind of like the "acheivments" in minecraft, but they actually get you something
12:46 Ryan Jensen: yes
12:47 JPisaBrony: ok
12:51 Ryan Jensen: and just at the beginning
12:56 Ryan Jensen: just warm the player up
13:06 Ryan Jensen: soon, the quests start getting more complex
13:15 Ryan Jensen: like, "suck the giant dick in the sex dungeon"
13:19 JPisaBrony: xD
13:25 JPisaBrony: but HOW?!?!
13:25 JPisaBrony: xD
13:29 Ryan Jensen: with SOUP
13:32 Ryan Jensen: ooh
13:34 Ryan Jensen: yeah
13:35 JPisaBrony: wat. lol
13:41 Ryan Jensen: we should add soup to the game
13:44 JPisaBrony: yeah
13:50 JPisaBrony: chicken noodle soup
14:02 AM | Edited 12:14:05 JPisaBrony: without the chicken meat
14:27 JPisaBrony: so its just noodles and broth, yet called chicken noodle soup
14:46 JPisaBrony: made from wood
14:51 Ryan Jensen: make a recipie like this:
chicken breast + water + carrots + celery + noodles = cambels (c) chicken noodle soup
15:02 Ryan Jensen: ooh!
15:03 JPisaBrony: cambles (c) xD
15:12 Ryan Jensen: we could make noodles from wheat flour
15:22 JPisaBrony: and the bowl from wood?
15:28 Ryan Jensen: sure!
15:47 AM | Edited 12:15:59 JPisaBrony: lol, my nonsensical thoughs actually ment something this time
15:49 Ryan Jensen: I'm thinking that the user has to "learn" recipies
16:04 Ryan Jensen: or aquire recipies
16:16 Ryan Jensen: maybe you find them in dungeons or chests or something
16:25 Ryan Jensen: maybe they are rewards for finishing quests
16:31 AM | Edited 12:16:48 JPisaBrony: i like that idea. but there should probly be a few basic ones at the begining
16:47 Ryan Jensen: "You defated the dragon. here is a recipie for a breakfast item"
16:53 JPisaBrony: xD
16:55 JPisaBrony: LUCKY CHARMS
16:57 Ryan Jensen: LOL
17:08 Ryan Jensen: you successfully slaid the dragon
17:13 Ryan Jensen: you WERE after his lucky charms
17:18 Ryan Jensen: (the dragon was irish)
17:19 JPisaBrony: xD
17:32 Ryan Jensen: ooh
17:44 Ryan Jensen: we could make generic breakfast cerial from wheat flour too
17:58 Ryan Jensen: or a NAME BRAND
18:00 JPisaBrony: mmm, corn flakes
18:15 JPisaBrony: or, wheat flakes
18:20 Ryan Jensen: Cheerios (tm) Cereal - From Kellogs
18:23 JPisaBrony: xD
18:39 AM | Edited 12:19:19 JPisaBrony: or, Wheat Flour in a bowl ??
19:10 Ryan Jensen: LOL
19:31 Ryan Jensen: eat an entire bowl of wheat flour >> - 30 speed
19:34 JPisaBrony: xD
19:34 Ryan Jensen: +20 bloating
19:38 JPisaBrony: lol
19:45 Ryan Jensen: we need eggs
19:52 Ryan Jensen: so chickens would be cool
19:55 JPisaBrony: yeah
19:57 Ryan Jensen: also
19:58 Ryan Jensen: cows
20:00 Ryan Jensen: pigs
20:02 Ryan Jensen: sheep
20:08 AM | Edited 12:20:20 JPisaBrony: and dinosaurs
20:11 Ryan Jensen: LOL
20:19 Ryan Jensen: slimes
20:24 Ryan Jensen: endermen
20:31 AM | Edited 12:20:33 JPisaBrony: cant forget about ponies either
20:31 Ryan Jensen: zombie pigmen
20:35 Ryan Jensen: yeah
20:44 Ryan Jensen: we could make everyone look like twilight
20:47 JPisaBrony: xD
20:55 AM | Edited 12:20:56 Ryan Jensen: and have GRAPHIC SCENES of the player BUTCHERING her
20:59 JPisaBrony: lol
21:06 Ryan Jensen: and carving out the precious pony meat
21:10 Ryan Jensen: and making a stew
21:23 Ryan Jensen: and then feeding the stew to other ponies that look EXACTLY LIKE TWILIGHT
21:28 JPisaBrony: lol xD
21:32 AM | Edited 12:21:43 JPisaBrony: cabalism should be cannon in this game
21:46 Ryan Jensen: lol
21:58 Ryan Jensen: did you see domo's idea for the character's origin
22:10 JPisaBrony: i must have missed it
22:10 AM | Edited 12:22:17 Ryan Jensen: a man made of rock, forged by the *demigods
22:23 Ryan Jensen: I thought that sounded cool
22:25 JPisaBrony: wow, that is an awesome backstory
22:29 Ryan Jensen: IKR?
22:41 JPisaBrony: >rock hard dick
22:43 Ryan Jensen: the gods made this man in an attempt to have this person help them
22:44 Ryan Jensen: LOL
22:55 AM | Edited 12:22:58 Ryan Jensen: so you were created with the sole purpose of helping the demigods
23:10 JPisaBrony: ok. cool. sounds good
23:57 Ryan Jensen: and then once you help them all, they respect you and tell you, "You've done better than we dared hope. You are truely our savior. But there is no more work for you to do here. Please, go out and live your life as a free being."
23:59 Ryan Jensen: something like that
24:09 AM | Edited 12:24:29 Ryan Jensen: the demigods respect you and are grateful for your service
24:12 Ryan Jensen: :3
24:39 JPisaBrony: ok, sounds like a decent story. lol
24:44 Ryan Jensen: yeah
24:51 Ryan Jensen: that could get us through the first story arch
25:01 Ryan Jensen: and i'm sure we can figure out the next one as we go along
25:07 Ryan Jensen: I really do like the rock thing
25:18 Ryan Jensen: but if the character is made of rock, it has no need to eat
25:27 AM | Edited 12:25:29 JPisaBrony: yeah... lol
25:27 Ryan Jensen: (also, I want the character to be non-gender specific)
25:33 JPisaBrony: ok
25:44 Ryan Jensen: so I'm thinking, maybe the gods created a hard rocky shell for the player
25:48 Ryan Jensen: but the insides are still organic
25:55 Ryan Jensen: and so he is still a living, breathing creature
26:07 JPisaBrony: ok
26:10 Ryan Jensen: just an idea
26:23 JPisaBrony: yes, brainstorming has been a lot of fun so far. lol
26:25 Ryan Jensen: yeah
26:36 JPisaBrony: so, i think there is a hole in the questing stuff earlier. so you were talking about other people in the game, (like james) but i thought it was after an apocalypse
26:47 Ryan Jensen: yes
27:00 Ryan Jensen: I'm thinking there might be some survivors
27:04 Ryan Jensen: or some small vilages
27:06 Ryan Jensen: or something
27:08 JPisaBrony: ok
27:12 Ryan Jensen: or maybe they aren't even human
27:14 JPisaBrony: so not completely empty
27:17 Ryan Jensen: yes
27:24 Ryan Jensen: there are going to be a good deal of NPCs
27:26 JPisaBrony: alians!?!
THE DOCTOR HAS RETURNED
27:28 Ryan Jensen: xD
27:45 Ryan Jensen: maybe they are mutants
27:49 Ryan Jensen: or some new species
27:51 Ryan Jensen: or i don't know
27:54 JPisaBrony: ok
27:59 Ryan Jensen: maybe that part isn't even explained
28:14 JPisaBrony: yeah, or maby we come up with a new idea for the backstory?
28:18 Ryan Jensen: yes
28:33 Ryan Jensen: maybe this isn't even earth necessarily
28:46 Ryan Jensen: so then there would definitely not be any humans
28:52 JPisaBrony: In a Galaxy Far Far Away....
28:58 Ryan Jensen: and the year would also be ambiguous and irrelevant
29:15 JPisaBrony: ok
29:39 JPisaBrony: yeah, some distant planet with rock creatures would be interesting
29:59 JPisaBrony: since the terrain is kind of rocky already
30:14 Ryan Jensen: but then...
30:19 Ryan Jensen: all the food would have to be different
30:33 JPisaBrony: damn... your right. lol
30:38 Ryan Jensen: hmmm
30:41 JPisaBrony: we just make it brown instead? xD
30:45 Ryan Jensen: maybe earth would be better
31:17 Ryan Jensen: maybe we don't need to explain all of it
31:33 Ryan Jensen: you know?
31:54 Ryan Jensen: make up a bunch of weird creatures, but keep the familiar food.
32:02 JPisaBrony: yeah, but i think the most back story we figure out now, the easier it will be to think of ideas for future stuff
32:12 AM | Edited 12:32:15 Ryan Jensen: yes
32:19 Ryan Jensen: I think you are right
32:53 JPisaBrony: and i also think that is it is 12:32 AM, so its time for bed. lol
33:24 Ryan Jensen: oh fine
33:43 Ryan Jensen: what if the character is wandering the world
33:54 Ryan Jensen: and finds an odd cave
34:06 Ryan Jensen: he sees a pedestal at the back
34:06 JPisaBrony: Biome to Biome you shall roam, roam, roam.
34:11 Ryan Jensen: XD
34:13 JPisaBrony: xD
34:14 JPisaBrony: ok
34:23 Ryan Jensen: he approaches the pedestal
34:34 Ryan Jensen: and when he comes in contact, he hears the voice of the demigod
34:47 Ryan Jensen: (I was thinking the demigods would be beings without physical form)
35:02 Ryan Jensen: so you would approach the pedestal and then you can talk to the demigod
35:06 JPisaBrony: well, they are gods so that makes sence
35:32 JPisaBrony: but, what about being able to talk to them? would you go to there "shrine" or something?
35:36 Ryan Jensen: did you see the "demigods' lairs" picture?
35:40 JPisaBrony: yeah
35:42 Ryan Jensen: ok
35:50 Ryan Jensen: yeah you need to go to the shrine to speak with them
35:56 JPisaBrony: ok
36:22 Ryan Jensen: (from a programming point of view, the demigods are the little tablet sitting on the pedestal)
36:31 Ryan Jensen: and their hitbox is a 1x1 cell area
36:37 JPisaBrony: lol
